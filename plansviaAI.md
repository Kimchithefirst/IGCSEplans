### 3.3 Example Questions by Subject

#### Mathematics
**Topic: Algebra - Quadratic Equations**
*Question: Solve the quadratic equation: 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0*
- **Solution**: x = (-5 ± √(25 + 24)) / 4 = (-5 ± √49) / 4 = (-5 ± 7) / 4
- **Answer**: x = 0.5 or x = -3
- **Examples**: 
  - When x = 0.5: 2(0.5)² + 5(0.5) - 3 = 0.5 + 2.5 - 3 = 0 ✓
  - When x = -3: 2(-3)² + 5(-3) - 3 = 18 - 15 - 3 = 0 ✓

#### Physics
**Topic: Forces and Motion**
*Question: A car accelerates from rest to 20 m/s in 5 seconds. Calculate the acceleration and the distance traveled.*
- **Solution**: 
  - Acceleration = (20 - 0) / 5 = 4 m/s²
  - Distance = ½ × 4 × 5² = 50 meters
- **Answer**: Acceleration = 4 m/s², Distance = 50 m
- **Examples**: 
  - Real-world application: Sports car accelerating from traffic light
  - Similar problems: Train accelerating from station, rocket launch
  - Formula verification: v = u + at → 20 = 0 + 4(5) ✓

#### Chemistry
**Topic: Chemical Bonding**
*Question: Draw the Lewis structure for carbon dioxide (CO₂) and explain why it is a non-polar molecule.*
- **Solution**: 
  - O=C=O (linear structure)
  - Non-polar because the dipole moments cancel out due to linear geometry
- **Answer**: Linear structure with zero net dipole moment
- **Examples**: 
  - Similar molecules: CS₂ (carbon disulfide), BeCl₂ (beryllium chloride)
  - Polar vs non-polar: H₂O (polar) vs CO₂ (non-polar)
  - Real-world: CO₂ in carbonated drinks, photosynthesis

#### Biology
**Topic: Cell Biology**
*Question: Compare and contrast the structure and function of plant and animal cells.*
- **Solution**: 
  - Plant cells: cell wall, chloroplasts, large vacuole
  - Animal cells: no cell wall, no chloroplasts, small vacuoles
  - Both: nucleus, mitochondria, cell membrane
- **Answer**: Key differences in organelles and cell wall presence
- **Examples**: 
  - Plant cell examples: leaf cells, root cells, stem cells
  - Animal cell examples: muscle cells, nerve cells, blood cells
  - Function examples: photosynthesis (plants), movement (animals)

#### English Literature
**Topic: Poetry Analysis**
*Question: Analyze the use of imagery in William Wordsworth's "Daffodils" and explain how it contributes to the poem's theme.*
- **Solution**: 
  - Visual imagery: "golden daffodils"
  - Movement imagery: "fluttering and dancing"
  - Theme: connection between nature and human emotion
- **Answer**: Imagery creates vivid sensory experience supporting nature-human connection theme
- **Examples**: 
  - Other imagery in poem: "continuous as the stars that shine"
  - Similar poems: "The Solitary Reaper" by Wordsworth
  - Literary devices: simile, personification, metaphor

#### English Language
**Topic: Grammar and Vocabulary**
*Question: Identify the parts of speech in the sentence: "The curious student eagerly studied the complex mathematical problem."*
- **Solution**: 
  - The (article), curious (adjective), student (noun), eagerly (adverb), studied (verb), the (article), complex (adjective), mathematical (adjective), problem (noun)
- **Answer**: Article, adjective, noun, adverb, verb, article, adjective, adjective, noun
- **Examples**: 
  - Similar sentences: "The brave firefighter quickly rescued the frightened child."
  - Grammar patterns: Article + Adjective + Noun + Adverb + Verb
  - Word families: curious → curiosity, mathematical → mathematics

#### History
**Topic: World War I**
*Question: Explain the causes of World War I and evaluate which factor was most significant.*
- **Solution**: 
  - MAIN causes: Militarism, Alliances, Imperialism, Nationalism
  - Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand as trigger
  - Most significant: Alliance system creating domino effect
- **Answer**: Multiple causes with alliance system as most critical factor
- **Examples**: 
  - Alliance examples: Triple Entente (Britain, France, Russia) vs Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy)
  - Domino effect: Austria declares war on Serbia → Russia mobilizes → Germany declares war on Russia → France joins → Britain joins
  - Modern parallels: NATO alliances, military pacts

#### Geography
**Topic: Population Studies**
*Question: Describe the demographic transition model and explain why birth rates decline in Stage 3.*
- **Solution**: 
  - Stage 3: Birth rates fall, death rates low
  - Reasons: urbanization, education, family planning, women's rights
  - Economic development reduces need for large families
- **Answer**: Economic and social changes reduce fertility rates in developing societies
