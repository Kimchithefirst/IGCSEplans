## Sample Questions (Advanced Level)

### Mathematics
**Solve the system of equations: x² + y² = 25 and x + y = 7, then find the exact value of sin(2θ) where θ is the angle between the line and positive x-axis.**
- Answer: x = 4, y = 3 or x = 3, y = 4; sin(2θ) = 24/25
- Example: Application in coordinate geometry and trigonometry

### Physics
**A particle moves in a circular path of radius 2m with angular velocity ω = 3t² rad/s. At t = 2s, find the tangential acceleration, centripetal acceleration, and total acceleration vector.**
- Answer: a_t = 24 m/s², a_c = 72 m/s², |a_total| = 75.9 m/s²
- Example: Satellite orbital mechanics, particle accelerators

### Chemistry
**Calculate the pH of a 0.1M solution of CH₃COOH (Ka = 1.8×10⁻⁵) and determine the percentage ionization. Then predict how the pH changes when 0.05M NaOH is added.**
- Answer: pH = 2.87, 1.34% ionized, pH increases to 4.74 (buffer region)
- Example: Buffer solutions in biological systems, acid-base equilibria

### Biology
**Explain the molecular mechanism of DNA replication, including the role of DNA polymerase, helicase, and ligase. Then describe how mutations in these enzymes could lead to genetic disorders.**
- Answer: Semi-conservative replication with leading/lagging strands, proofreading mechanisms
- Example: Cancer development, genetic diseases like xeroderma pigmentosum

### English Literature
**Compare the use of dramatic irony in Shakespeare's "Othello" and Sophocles' "Oedipus Rex". Analyze how this literary device contributes to the tragic structure and audience engagement in both works.**
- Answer: Different types of irony (verbal vs situational), audience knowledge vs character ignorance
- Example: Modern applications in film and theater, psychological impact on readers

### English Language
**Analyze the syntactic structure of the sentence: "The fact that the committee, despite having been warned repeatedly about the potential consequences of their decision, proceeded with the controversial proposal suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of their responsibilities."**
- Answer: Complex sentence with embedded clauses, nominalization, passive voice construction
- Example: Academic writing patterns, legal document analysis

### History
**Evaluate the extent to which the Treaty of Versailles was responsible for the rise of Nazi Germany. Consider economic, political, and social factors, and compare with other contributing causes.**
- Answer: Versailles created conditions but wasn't sole cause; hyperinflation, political instability, Great Depression
- Example: Modern treaty negotiations, post-war reconstruction challenges

### Geography
**Using the concept of carrying capacity, analyze how climate change will affect agricultural productivity in the Sahel region. Consider both direct impacts and feedback loops with population dynamics.**
- Answer: Reduced rainfall, soil degradation, migration patterns, food security challenges
- Example: Current climate adaptation strategies, sustainable development goals
